# StoreLayoutHandle

This module will add a layout handle store_<YOUR_STORE_CODE>. With this you can change storefront by adding layout updates to the store handle.
This way can save you from adding a new theme for minor changes like you just want to change the color of store front and remove some blocks. You just need to add a new style sheet to the handle to override css rules and can remove any block loaded by other layout handles.
